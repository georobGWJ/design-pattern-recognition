# design-pattern-recognition

In this repo, I am implementing examples of the canonical software design patterns described in the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/).

Why?
I want to learn these and just as importantly to improve my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) coding skills.

Errata: [Pattern Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_Recognition_(novel)) is one of the best two novels written by William Gibson (the other, of course, being [Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer)). This isn't directly related to this repo, but influenced it's naming. Cheers.
